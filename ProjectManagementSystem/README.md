# Funded-Project-Tracker System

![FP-Tracker-Logo](assets/logo.png?raw=true)

A centralized online platform, with a web-application interface, to manage internally and externally funded **research projects** 

> Deployed as an internal web-application on the intra-network of the college. Currently under use at the Department of Computer Science for managing research project proposals, status, and outcomes.

It handles the following key aspects:
- Resource management, tracking, and repurposing for internally funded projects.
- Project status, updates, and outcomes repository for all projects in the past and present.
- Filterable and customized summary statistics of faculty and student projects, organized by domain and tech stack.
- Resource inventory and project deliverable/outcome report generation for all projects.





## Procedure to Execute

### Common Dependencies

- nodejs 16.15.0 LTS (preferably, with nvm)

### Frontend
- Navigate to ./FPTrack-frontend
- Install local dependencies using `npm install` from current context
- Run `npm run dev` to get the frontend service going

### Backend
- Navigate to ./FPTrack-backend
- Ensure that all `global installs` are done
- Install local dependencies using `npm install` from current context
- Run `npm run serverstart` to get the development server going

## Frontend

### UI/UX Design Plan
- Find the specifications document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRCV0GmPHsXNXjA9UHeSrwmuguNEEI4yCPcC1Dmvwz4/edit?usp=sharing): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jRCV0GmPHsXNXjA9UHeSrwmuguNEEI4yCPcC1Dmvwz4/edit?usp=sharing

### Validations to handle
- PDF Proposal Upload must be under 8MB (soft limit)

### Server-Client Behavior Agreeement
- When new user uses OAuth to register, the token validation (POST /api/auth/) will return with,
  ```
  {
      error_code: 901,
      message: "User must be created",
      url: "/api/user/",
      method: "POST"
  }
  HTTP_CODE: 404
  ```
  Initiate a form on the frontend to collect user metadata i.e. role, access, etc. and create a user using the given URL and METHOD.
  Then, send the same token  to the token validation (POST /api/auth/) endpoint.
  
### Tailored API Endpoints

**NOTE**: Specify API endpoint requirements under `Requested Endpoint Requirements` [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BuqWLfZSf08XkSRbJId3BAIZCT0FmTrVLlO-6XchuT4/edit?usp=sharing): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BuqWLfZSf08XkSRbJId3BAIZCT0FmTrVLlO-6XchuT4/edit?usp=sharing

#### GET api/user[?field=value&...]

- Resonds with all user collections
- Now supports **filters**! Multiple filters may be used 
- The following fields can be used for fitering by being passed as GET query parameters,
  - `?email=abc@gmail.com`
  - `?first_name=Adam` : Case-sensitive for now
  - `?last_name=Adam` : Case-sensitive for now
  - `?role=student` : One of `faculty`, `student`

#### GET api/proposal/user/[userId]

- `userId` is the `_id` field value of the user
- Responds with all projects belonging to the specified user, like so
  ```
  {
    as_supervisor: [ <proposal collections with the user as a supervisor>... ],
    as_member: 	[ <proposal collections with the user as a member>... ],
    as_leader: 	[ <propoal collections with the user as a leader>... ]
  }
  ```

#### GET api/project/user/[userId]

- `userId` is the `_id` field value of the user
- Responds with all projects belonging to the specified user, like so
  ```
  {
    as_supervisor: [ <project collections with the user as a supervisor>... ],
    as_member: 	[ <project collections with the user as a member>... ],
    as_leader: 	[ <project collections with the user as a leader>... ]
  }
  ```
#### GET api/resource-group?available=[anything]

- `[anything]` is an arbitrary value. This is parsed for GET syntactic convenience - value ignored
- The key `available` is of importance
- Responds with all resource groups having allocatable resources along with an additional field `avl_qty` to denote number of resource instances of the group that can be allotted, like so
 ```
 [
  {
    <all-resource-group fields> : <field-values>,
    .
    .
    avl_qty: 2
  }
  .
  .
 ]
```

#### PUT api/resource-assignment

With request body,
```
{
  rsrc_mgr_id = '<manager_id>',
  project_id = '<project_id>',
  rsrc_grp_id = '<resource_group_id>',
  qty = 1
}
```

- The `id`s correspond the the `_id` fields of the respective resources
- `qty` refers to the number of assignments of that `resource group` desired at the end of this transaction. This can be lower or higher than the current number of allocations

- Responds with the type of changes made:
  - If current assignments are same as `qty`, 
  ```
  {"total_qty":2,"assigned_qty":0,"message":"No resource assignments made"}
  ```
  - If new assignments were made:
  ```
  {"total_qty":4,"assigned_qty":1,"project_id":"62a4e23619d791faaf76e19a","resource_group_id":"628abd6b4bc531d7264a0aaa","message":"Resource deallocations made"}
  ```
  - If assignments were removed:
  ```
  {"total_qty":4,"assigned_qty":1,"project_id":"62a4e23619d791faaf76e19a","resource_group_id":"628abd6b4bc531d7264a0aaa","message":"Resource deallocations made"}
  ```
  *Numbers above are samples only*
  
 **NOTE**: If the available qty CANNOT satisfy the request, maximum possible qty is assigned. Eg: If only 3 resources can be allocated, and the request is made for 4, then 3 items are allocated and the response indicated the same through `assigned_qty` field

#### GET api/resource-assignment/project/[projectId]

- `[projectId]` is the project id of the project whose resource allocations are being requested
- Responds with all resource allocation records for the project resources along, with three additional fields:
  - `_id` denoting the ID of the resource group
  - `assigned_qty` to denote number of resource instances of the group already allotted
  - `resource_data` containing specific resource details, along with the ID of its resource group
 ```
 [
  {
    _id: <resource-group id>
    <all-resource-allocation fields> : <field-values>,
    .
    .
    resource_data : [ { <all resource fields> : <field-values> } ]
    assigned_qty: 2
  }
  .
  .
 ]
```

#### PATCH api/proposal/reject : To REJECT a proposal

With request body,
```
{
  id: '62912ac4f4ebb586b9b82e02',
  remarks: 'Needs more novelty'
}
```
- `id` is the corresponding proposal's `_id` field
- `remarks` is the remarks given during rejection, by the scrutiny team (if any)
- Marks the proposal as `rejected`, as long as it is `pending decision` state --- neither approved nor rejected to far
- Responds with the proposal's `_id`  and updation status.

#### POST api/project : To ACCEPT a proposal

With request body,
```
{
  proposal = <proposal_id>,
  approved_budget = 10000,
  approved_duration = 20
}
```
- `proposal` is the corresponding proposal's `_id` field
- `approved_duration` is the the approved project duration in months
- Marks the proposal as `rejected`, as long as it is `pending decision` state --- neither approved nor rejected to far
- Responds with the proposal's `_id`  and updation status.

#### PATCH api/project/update-status : To add a status update for a project

With request body like so,
```
{
  id: '62912ac4f4ebb586b9b82e02',
  title: 'Lit survey done',
  description: 'reviewed 10 directions'
}
```
- `id` is the corresponding project's `_id` field
- `title` is a short name for the update
- `description` (optional) is a short description about the status update
- Updates are `rejected` if they are made more frequently than 2 days i.e. the second update in a continual period of 2 days is rejected
- Responds with the proposal's `_id`, a short message and the update title

#### PATCH api/project/update-status : To add a status update for a project

With request body like so,
```
{
  id = <project_id>,
  title = "Patent submitted",
  description = "Fully approved design patent made",
  kind = "patent",
  reference = "www.patents.com/aaa123"
}
```
- `id` is the corresponding project's `_id` field
- `title` is a short name for the update
- `description` (optional) is a short description about the status update
- `kind` is one of the allowed outcomes. Look into the `project` schema definition.
- `reference` is basically an external URL to prove the outcome
- Updates are `rejected` if they are made more frequently than 2 days i.e. the second update in a continual period of 2 days is rejected
- Responds with the proposal's `_id`, a short message and the update title
